# Option-Pricing-Visualiser
A modular Python project that takes option parameters, computes the Black–Scholes premium, generates a range of future stock prices (50–150% of S_0), calculates call option payoffs, applies the risk-neutral probability density, computes the expected discounted payoff, and visualises the results.
